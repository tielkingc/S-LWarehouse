# S & L Warehouse

<br>

# Description
  ## This MERN stack web app was built for a storage business, S & L Warehouse, to improve their customer experience. The app contains a database that houses important company information for ownership. Potential customers will have the ability to send an email to request an avalable unit or be placed on a waitlist. The business owner will have the ability to log in as an admin and reserve units for customers or add, edit, and delete users. Current customers can log in as users to see information about the unit(s) they are currently renting.
